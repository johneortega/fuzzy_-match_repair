annex v
indonesian timber legality assurance system
introduction
objective : to provide assurance that harvesting , transportation , processing and selling of round logs and processed timber products comply with all relevant indonesian laws and regulations .
known for its pioneering role in combating illegal logging and the trade in illegally harvested timber and timber products , indonesia hosted the east asia ministerial conference on forest law enforcement and governance ( fleg ) in bali , in september 2001 , which resulted in the declaration on forest law enforcement and governance &apos; ( bali declaration ) .
since then , indonesia has continued to be at the forefront of international cooperation in combating illegal logging and associated trade .
as part of international efforts to address these issues , a growing number of consumer countries have committed themselves to take measures to prevent trade in illegal timber on their markets , whilst producer countries have committed themselves to provide a mechanism assuring the legality of their timber products .
it is important to establish a credible system to guarantee the legality of harvesting , transportation , processing and trade of timber processed timber products .
the indonesian timber legality assurance system ( tlas ) provides assurance that timber and timber products produced and processed in indonesia come from legal sources and are in full compliance with relevant indonesian laws and regulations , as verified by independent auditing and monitored by civil society .
indonesian laws and regulations as foundation of the tlas
the indonesian regulation on the &quot; standards and guidelines on the assessment of performance of sustainable forest management and the verification of timber legality in the state and privately-owned forests &quot; ( forestry minister &apos;s regulation p.38 / menhut-ii / 2009 ) establish the tlas as well as the sustainability scheme ( sfm ) , to improve forest governance ; to suppress illegal logging and the associated timber trade and to ensure the credibility and improve the image of indonesia &apos;s timber products .
the tlas comprises the following elements :
legality standards ,
control of supply chain ,
verification procedures ,
licensing scheme ,
monitoring .
tlas is the basic system used to assure the legality of timber and timber products produced in indonesia for export to the union and to other markets .
development of the tlas : a multi-stakeholder process
since 2003 , a wide range of indonesian forestry stakeholders have been actively engaged in developing , implementing and evaluating the tlas , thereby providing better oversight , transparency and credibility in the process .
in 2009 , the multi-stakeholder process resulted in the issuance of forestry minister &apos;s regulation p.38 / menhut-ii / 2009 , followed by dg forest utilization technical guidelines no.6 / vi-set / 2009 and no.02 / vi-bpphh / 2010 .
scope of the tlas
indonesian forest resources can broadly be divided into two types of ownership : state forests and privately owned forests / lands .
state forests consist of production forests for long-term sustainable timber production under a variety of permit types and forest areas that can be converted for non-forestry purposes such as for settlement or plantations .
the application of tlas on state forests and privately owned forests / lands is set out in annex ii .
the tlas covers timber and timber products from all permit types as well as the operations of all timber traders , downstream processors and exporters .
the tlas requires that imported timber and timber products are cleared at customs and comply with indonesia &apos;s import regulations .
imported timber and timber products must be accompanied by documents providing assurance of the legality of the timber in its country of harvest .
imported timber and timber products will have to enter into a controlled supply chain that complies with the indonesian rules and regulations .
indonesia will provide guidance on how to implement the above .
certain timber products may contain recycled materials .
indonesia provides guidance on how the use of recycled materials will be dealt with under the tlas .
impounded timber is not included in the tlas and therefore cannot be covered by a flegt licence .
the tlas covers timber products destined for domestic and international markets .
all indonesian producers , processors , and traders ( operators ) will be verified for legality , including those supplying the domestic market .
tlas legality standards
the tlas has five timber legality standards .
these standards and their verification guidelines are set out in annex ii .
the tlas also incorporates the &quot; standard and guidelines on assessment of performance in sustainable forest management ( sfm ) &quot; .
the assessment of sustainable forest management using the sfm standard also verifies that the auditee complies with the relevant legality criteria .
sfm-certified organisations operating within production forest zones on state-owned lands ( permanent forest domain ) adhere to both relevant legality and sfm standards .
control of the timber supply chain
the permit holder ( in the case of concessions ) or landowner ( in the case of private land ) or company ( in the case of traders , processors and exporters ) shall demonstrate that every node of their supply chain is controlled and documented as set out in the minister for forestry regulations p.55 / menhut-ii / 2006 and p.30 / menhut-ii / 2012 ( hereinafter referred to as the regulations ) .
these regulations require provincial and district forestry officials to undertake field verification and validate the documents which are submitted by permit holders , landowners , or processors at each node of the supply chain .
the operational controls at each point in the supply chain are summarised in diagram 1 ; the guidance for imports is being developed .
all consignments in the supply chain must be accompanied by relevant transport documents .
companies must apply appropriate systems to segregate between timber and timber products from verified sources with timber and timber products from other sources , and maintain records that distinguish between these two sources .
companies at each point in the supply chain are required to record whether the involved logs , products or timber consignment are tlas-verified .
operators in the supply chain are required to keep records on received , stored , processed and delivered timber and timber products so as to enable subsequent reconciliation of quantitative data between and within nodes of the supply chain .
such data shall be made available for provincial and district forestry officials to carry out reconciliation tests .
main activities and procedures , including reconciliation , for each stage of the supply chain are further explained in the appendix of this annex .

institutional set-up for legality verification and export licensing
the indonesian tlas is based on an approach known as &quot; operator-based licensing &quot; which has much in common with product or forest management certification systems .
the indonesian ministry of forestry nominates a number of conformity assessment bodies ( lp and lv ) which it authorizes to audit the legality of operations of timber producers , traders , processors and exporters ( &quot; operators &quot; ) .
the conformity assessment bodies ( cab ) are accredited by the indonesian national accreditation body ( kan ) .
cab are contracted by operators who want their operations to be certified as legal and are required to operate according to relevant iso guidelines .
they report the outcome of the audits to the auditee and to the ministry of forestry .
the cab ensure that the auditees operate in compliance with the indonesian legality definition as contained in annex ii , including controls to prevent material from unknown sources entering their supply chains .
when an auditee is found to be compliant , a legality certificate with a validity of 3 ( three ) years is issued .
lvs also act as export licensing authorities and check verified exporters &apos; supply chain control systems .
if compliant , they issue export licences in the form of v-legal documents .
thus exports without an export permit are prohibited .
indonesia has enacted a regulation which allows civil society groups to raise objections on the legality verification of an operator by cab or in the event of illegal activities detected during operations .
in case of complaints about the operations of a conformity assessment body , civil society groups can file complaints with kan .
the relationship between different entities involved in implementing the tlas is illustrated in diagram 2 :

conformity assessment bodies
the conformity assessment bodies play a key role in the indonesian system .
they are contracted to verify the legality of the production , processing and trade activities of individual companies in the supply chain , including the integrity of the supply chain .
lv also issue v-legal documents for individual shipments of exported timber .
there are two types of cab : ( i ) assessment bodies ( lembaga penilai / lp ) which audits the performance of forest management units ( fmus ) against the sustainability standard ; and ( ii ) verification bodies ( lembaga verifikasi / lv ) , which audit fmus and forest-based industries against the legality standards .
in order to ensure those audits that verify the legality standards as set out in annex ii are of the highest quality , the lp and lv are required to develop the necessary management systems addressing competency , consistency , impartiality , transparency , and assessment process requirements as outlined in iso / iec 17021 ( sfm standard for lps ) and / or iso / iec guide 65 ( legality standards for lvs ) .
these requirements are specified in the tlas guidelines .
lvs can also act as licensing authorities .
in this case the lvs issue export licences to cover timber products destined to international markets .
for non-union markets , the licensing authorities will issue v-legal documents , and as for the union market , flegt licenses will be issued in accordance with the requirements as outlined in annex iv .
indonesia is developing detailed procedures for the v-legal document or flegt licensing of export consignments .
the lvs are contracted by the auditees to carry out legality audits and will issue tlas legality certificates and v-legal document or flegt licences for exports to international markets .
accreditation body
the indonesian national accreditation body ( komite akreditasi nasional - kan ) is responsible for the accreditation of cab .
in case of problem with a lp or lv , complaints can be submitted to the kan .
on 14 july 2009 , the kan signed a memorandum of understanding with the ministry of forestry to provide accreditation services for the tlas .
kan is an independent accreditation body established through government regulation ( peraturan pemerintah / pp ) 102 / 2000 concerning national standardisation and presidential decree ( keputusan presiden / keppres ) 78 / 2001 regarding the national accreditation committee .
the kan operates under the guidance of iso / iec 17011 ( general requirements for accreditation bodies accrediting conformity assessment bodies ) .
it has developed internal tlas-specific supporting documents for the accreditation of lps ( dpls 13 ) and lvs ( dpls 14 ) .
in addition , the kan will develop requirements and guidance for the accreditation of lvs for export licensing .
kan is internationally recognised by the pacific accreditation cooperation ( pac ) and the international accreditation forum ( iaf ) to accredit certification bodies for quality management systems , environmental management systems and product certification .
kan is also recognised by the asia pacific laboratory accreditation cooperation ( aplac ) and the international laboratory accreditation cooperation ( ilac ) .
auditees
auditees are operators which are subject to legality verification .
they include forest management units ( concessionaires or timber utilization permit holders , community-based forest permit holders , private forest / land owners ) and forestry-based industries .
the forest management units and forest-based industries must comply with the applicable tlas standard .
for export purposes , the forest-based industries must comply with export licensing requirements .
the system allows auditees to submit appeals to the lp or lv on the conduct of or results of audits .
independent monitor
civil society plays a key role in the independent monitoring ( im ) of the tlas .
findings from the independent monitor can also be used as part of the periodic evaluation ( pe ) which is required under this agreement .
in the event of an assessment-related irregularity , complaints by civil society shall be submitted directly to the concerned lp or lv .
if no appropriate response is given to the complaints , civil society entities may file a report to the kan .
for accreditation-related irregularities , complaints shall be submitted directly to the kan .
whenever civil society entities discover wrongdoings by operators , they can lodge complaints with the relevant lp or lv .
the government
the ministry of forestry regulates the tlas and authorises the accredited lps to undertake sfm assessment and lvs to undertake legality verification and to issue v-legal documents .
furthermore , the ministry of forestry also regulates the licence information unit ( liu ) as a unit responsible for information exchange which receives and stores relevant data and information on the issuance of v-legal documents and which responds to queries from competent authorities or stakeholders .
legality verification
indonesian timber is deemed legal when its origin and production process as well as subsequent processing , transport and trade activities are verified as meeting all applicable indonesian laws and regulations , as set out in annex ii .
lvs carry out conformity assessments to verify compliance .
legality verification process
in accordance with iso / iec guide 65 and the tlas guidelines , the legality verification process consists of the following :
application and contracting : the permit holder submits to the lv an application that defines the scope of verification , permit holder &apos;s profile and other necessary information .
a contract between the permit holder and the lv , setting out the conditions for verification , is required prior to the commencement of the verification activities .
verification plan : after the signing of the verification contract , the lv prepares a verification plan , which includes nomination of the audit team , verification programme and schedule of activities .
the plan is communicated to the auditee and the dates of verification activities agreed upon .
this information shall be made available in advance for the independent monitors through the websites of lvs and the ministry of forestry or mass media .
verification activities : the verification audit consists of three stages : ( i ) opening audit meeting , ( ii ) document verification &amp; field observation and ( iii ) closing audit meeting .
opening audit meeting : the audit &apos;s objective , scope , schedule and methodology are discussed with the auditee , so as to allow the auditee to raise questions on methods and conduct of verification activities ;
document verification and field observation stage : in order to collect evidence on the auditee &apos;s compliance with the indonesian tlas requirements , lv checks the auditee &apos;s systems and procedures , relevant documents and records .
lv carries out field checks to verify compliance , including cross-checking the findings of official inspection reports .
lv also checks the auditee &apos;s timber traceability system to ensure that , with adequate evidence , all timber meets the legality requirements .
closing audit meeting : the verification results , in particular any non-compliances that may be detected , are presented to the auditee .
the auditee may raise questions on the verification results and provide clarification on the evidence presented by the lv .
reporting and decision making : the audit team draws up a verification report , following a structure provided by the ministry of forestry .
the report is shared with the auditee within fourteen calendar days after the closing audit meeting .
a copy of the report , which includes a description of any findings of non-compliances , is submitted to the ministry of forestry .
the report is used primarily to decide on the outcome of the verification audit by the lv .
the lv takes the decision on whether to issue a legality certificate based on the verification report prepared by the audit team .
in cases of non-compliance , the lv will refrain from issuing a legality certificate , which will prevent the timber from entering the supply chain of verified legal timber .
once the non-compliance has been addressed , the operator may resubmit a request for legality verification .
infringements , which are discovered by lv during the verification and reported to the ministry of forestry , shall be handled by the responsible authorities in accordance with administrative or judicial procedures .
if an operator is suspected of breaching regulations , the national , provincial and district authorities may decide to halt the operator &apos;s activities .
issuance of the legality certificate and recertification : the lv will issue a legality certificate if an auditee is found to comply with all the indicators in the legality standard , including the rules on control of the timber supply chain .
the lv may report at any time to the ministry of forestry on issued , changed , suspended and withdrawn certificates and every three months shall issue a report .
the ministry of forestry will then publish these reports on its website .
a legality certificate is valid for a period of three years , after which the operator is subject to a re-certification audit .
the re-certification shall be done prior to the expiry date of the certificate .
surveillance : operators with a legality certificate are subject to annual surveillance that follow the principles of the verification activities summarised above .
the lv may also carry out surveillance earlier than scheduled before the annual audit if the scope of the verification has been extended .
the surveillance team draws up a surveillance report .
a copy of the report , including a description of any non-compliance found , is submitted to the ministry of forestry .
non-compliances detected by the surveillance will result in to suspension or withdrawal of the legality certificate .
infringements discovered by the lv during the surveillance and reported to the ministry of forestry shall be handled by the relevant authorities , in accordance with administrative or judicial procedures .
special audits : operators with a legality certificate are obliged to report to the lv any significant changes in ownership , structures , management , and operations that affect the quality of its legality controls during the period of validity of the certificate .
the lv may carry out special audits to investigate any complaints or disputes filed by the independent monitors , government institutions or other stakeholders or upon receipt of the operator &apos;s report on changes that affect the quality of its legality controls
government responsibility for enforcement
the ministry of forestry , as well as provincial and district forestry offices are responsible for the control of timber supply chains and checking of related documents ( e.g. annual work plans , log felling reports , log balance-sheet reports , transport documents , logs / raw material / processed products balance-sheet reports and production tally sheets ) .
in the event of inconsistencies , forestry officials may withhold approval of the control documents resulting in a suspension of operations .
infringements detected by forestry officials or by independent monitors are communicated to the lv , which upon verification may lead the lv to suspend or withdraw the awarded legality certificate .
forestry officials may take appropriate follow-up action in accordance with the regulatory procedures .
the ministry of forestry also receives copies of the verification reports and subsequent surveillance and special audit reports issued by the lvs .
infringements discovered by the lvs , by forestry officials or by independent monitors are handled in accordance with administrative and judicial procedures .
if an operator is suspected of breaching regulations , the national , provincial and district authorities may decide to suspend or halt the operator &apos;s activities .
flegt licensing
the indonesian flegt licence is known as the &quot; v-legal document &quot; .
this is an export licence that provides evidence that the timber products exported meet the indonesian legality standard as set out in annex ii and were sourced from a supply chain with adequate controls against the inflow of timber from unknown sources .
the v-legal document is issued by the lvs who act as licensing authorities and will be used as a flegt licence for shipments to the union once the parties have agreed to start the flegt licensing scheme .
indonesia will clearly define the procedures for issuing v-legal documents and communicate these procedures to the exporters and any other parties concerned through its licensing authorities ( the lvs ) and the website of the ministry of forestry .
the ministry of forestry has established a licence information unit to maintain a database with copies of all v-legal documents and lv non-compliance reports .
in the event of an inquiry concerning the authenticity , completeness , and validity of the v-legal document or flegt licence , the competent authorities in the union will contact the licence information unit in the ministry of forestry for further clarification .
this unit will communicate with the relevant lv .
the licence information unit will respond to the competent authorities upon receipt of the information from the lv .
the v-legal document is issued at the point at which the export consignment is established prior to the transportation to the point of export .
the procedure is as follows :
the v-legal document is issued by the lv , which holds a contract with the exporter , for the consignment of timber products to be exported .
the exporter &apos;s internal traceability system shall provide evidence on the legality of timber for export licensing .
this system shall at minimum cover all the supply chain related controls from the stage where the raw materials ( such as logs or semi-processed products ) were dispatched to the processing mill , within the mill site itself and from the mill to the point of export .
with regard to the primary industry , the exporter &apos;s traceability system shall at minimum cover transportation from the log landing or log yard and all the subsequent stages until the point of export .
with regard to the secondary industry , the traceability system shall at minimum cover transportation from the primary industry and all subsequent stages until the point of export .
if managed by the exporter , any previous stage of the supply chain as referred to in 6.2.1 and 6.2.2 shall also be included in the exporter &apos;s internal traceability system .
if managed by a legal entity than the exporter , the lv shall verify that the previous stages of the supply chain as referred to in 6.2.1 and 6.2.2 are controlled by the exporter &apos;s supplier ( s ) or sub-supplier ( s ) , and that the transport documents state whether the timber originates or does not originate from a felling site that has not been certified for legality .
for a v-legal document to be issued , all suppliers in the exporter &apos;s supply chain that make up the consignment must have been covered by a valid legality or sfm certificate and must demonstrate that at all stages in the supply chain the supply of legally verified timber has been kept segregated from supplies not covered by a valid legality or sfm certificate .
to obtain a v-legal document , a company must be a registered exporter ( an etpik holder ) who possesses a valid legality certificate .
the etpik holder submits a letter of application to the lv and attaches the following documents to demonstrate that the timber raw materials in the product originate only from verified legal sources :
a summary of the transport documents for all timber / raw materials received by the factory since the last audit ( up to max twelve months ) ; and
summaries of timber / raw material balance-sheet reports and processed timber balance-sheet reports since the last audit ( up to max twelve months ) ;
the lv then carries out the following verification steps :
data reconciliation based on the summaries of the transport documents , timber / raw material balance-sheet report , and processed timber balance-sheet report ;
control of the recovery rate ( s ) for each type of product , based on analysis of the timber / raw material balance-sheet report and processed timber balance-sheet report ;
result of verification :
if an etpik holder complies with legality and supply chain requirements , then the lv issues a v-legal document in the format presented in annex iv ;
an etpik holder meeting the above mentioned requirements is allowed to use conformity marking on the products and / or packaging .
guidelines on the use of conformity marking have been developed .
if an etpik holder does not comply with the legality and supply chain requirements , lv will issue a non-compliance report instead of v-legal document .
the lv shall :
forward a copy of a v-legal document or non-compliance report to the ministry of forestry within twenty four hours from the time the decision was taken ;
submit a comprehensive report and a public summary report outlining the number of v-legal documents issued as well as the number and type of non-compliances detected to the ministry of forestry once every three months with copies to kan , ministry of trade , and ministry of industry ;
monitoring
the indonesian tlas includes civil society monitoring ( independent monitoring ) and comprehensive evaluation ( ce ) .
to make the system even more robust for a flegt-vpa , a period evaluation ( pe ) component is added .
im is carried out by civil society to assess compliance of the operators , lps , and lvs with the indonesian tlas requirements including accreditation standards and guidelines .
civil society is defined in this context as indonesian legal entities including forestry ngos , communities living in and around the forest , and individual indonesian citizens .
ce is carried out by multi-stakeholder team which review the indonesian tlas and identify gaps and possible system improvements as mandated by the ministry of forestry .
the objective of pe is to provide independent assurance that the indonesian tlas is functioning as described , thereby enhancing the credibility of the flegt licences issued .
pe makes use of the findings and recommendations of im and ce .
terms of reference for pe are set out in annex vi .

annex viii
criteria for assessing the operationality of the indonesian timber legality assurance system
background
an independent technical evaluation of the indonesian tlas will be carried out before flegt licensing of timber exports to the union starts .
this technical evaluation will aim at : ( i ) examining the function of the tlas in practice to determine whether it delivers the intended results and ( ii ) examining any revisions made to the tlas after this agreement was signed ;
the criteria for this evaluation are set out below :

forest operations : compliance with legal requirements regarding forest management including compliance with relevant environmental and labour law and regulations ;
fees and taxes : compliance with legal requirements concerning taxes , royalties and fees directly related to timber harvesting rights and to timber harvesting ;
other users : respect for other parties &apos; legal tenure or rights of use of land and resources that may be affected by timber harvesting rights , where such other rights exist ;
trade and customs : compliance with legal requirements for trade and customs procedures .
key questions :
have the definition of legality and the legality verification standards been amended since this agreement was concluded ?

rules governing the financial contribution of israel to ‘ horizon 2020 — the framework programme for research and innovation ( 2014-2020 ) ’

the financial contribution of israel to the programme shall be established on a yearly basis in proportion to , and in addition to , the amount available each year in the general budget of the european union for commitment appropriations needed for the implementation , management and operation of the programme .
the proportionality factor governing the contribution of israel shall be obtained by establishing the ratio between the gross domestic product of israel , at market prices , and the sum of gross domestic products , at market prices , of the member states of the european union .
this ratio shall be calculated on the basis of the latest statistical data pertaining to the same year from the international bank for reconstruction and development , available at the time of publication of the draft budget of the european union .
the commission shall communicate to israel , as soon as possible , and at the latest on 1 september of the year before each financial year , the following information together with relevant background material :
the amounts in commitment appropriations , in the statement of expenditure of the draft budget of the european union corresponding to the programme ,
the estimated amount of the contributions derived from the draft budget , corresponding to the participation of israel in the programme according to paragraphs 1 , 2 and 3 .
once the general budget has been finally adopted , the commission shall communicate to israel , in the statement of expenditure corresponding to israel &apos; s participation , the final amounts referred to in the first subparagraph .
in the fourth year after this agreement becomes applicable , the parties shall review the proportionality factor governing the financial contribution of israel , on the basis of the data concerning participation of israeli legal entities in indirect and direct actions under the programme in the years 2014-2016 .
payment of israel &apos; s financial contribution
the commission shall issue , at the latest in january and june of each financial year , a call for funds to israel corresponding to its contribution under this agreement .
these calls for funds shall provide , respectively , for the payment of six-twelfths of israel &apos; s contribution not later than 90 days after receipt of the calls for funds .
however , the six-twelfths to be paid not later than 90 days after receipt of the call issued in january shall be calculated on the basis of the amount set out in the statement of revenue of the draft budget : the regularisation of the amount thus paid shall occur with the payment of the six-twelfths not later than 90 days after receipt of the call for funds issued at the latest in june .
for the first year of implementation of this agreement , the commission shall issue a first call for funds within 30 days of its entry into force .
should this call be issued after 15 june , it shall provide for the payment of twelve / twelfths of israel &apos; s contribution within 90 days , calculated on the basis of the amount set out in the statement of revenue of the budget .
the contribution of israel shall be expressed and paid in euro .
payment by israel shall be credited to the union programmes as budgetary revenue allocated to the appropriate budget heading in the statement of revenue of the general budget of the european union .
regulation ( eu , euratom ) no 966 / 2012 of the european parliament and of the council &#91; 1 &#93; hereinafter referred to as the ‘ financial regulation ’ applicable to the general budget of the european union shall apply to the management of the appropriations .
israel shall pay its contribution under this agreement according to the schedule in paragraph 1 .
any delay in the payment of the contribution shall give rise to the payment of default interest by israel on the outstanding amount from the due date .
the interest rate shall be the rate applied by the european central bank to its main refinancing operations in euro on the due date , increased by 1,5 percentage points .
in case the delay in the payment of the contribution is such that it may significantly jeopardise the implementation and management of the programme , participation in the programme of israel for the concerned financial year will be suspended by the commission following the absence of payment 20 working days after a formal letter of reminder sent to israel , without prejudice to the union &apos; s obligations according to grant agreements and / or contracts already concluded pertaining to the implementation of selected indirect actions .
at the latest on 30 june of the year following a financial year , the statement of appropriations for the programme that financial year shall be prepared and transmitted to israel for information , according to the format of the commission &apos; s revenue and expenditure account .
the commission , at the time of the closure of the accounts relating to each financial year , within the framework of the establishment of the revenue and expenditure account , shall proceed to the regularisation of the accounts with respect to the participation of israel .
this regularisation shall take into consideration modifications which have taken place , either by transfer , cancellations , carryovers , de-commitments , or by supplementary and amending budgets during the financial year .
